# CS 21 Machine Problem Solution

This repository contains my solution to the machine problem for CS 21. It includes two .asm files:

- `Solver_4.asm`: Solves 4x4 Sudoku boards
- `Solver_9.asm`: Solves 9x9 Sudoku boards

A detailed explanation of the solution can be found in the project document. To run the program using the MARS MIPS Simulator, refer to the document for the correct input format.
